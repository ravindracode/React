## 📘 React CDN Links Explained (Made Easy)

React can be used in two ways:

1.  **Using a build tool** (like `create-react-app`) – Recommended for real projects.
    
2.  **Using CDN links** – Quick and easy way to try React without installing anything.

### 🧩 What is a CDN?

CDN = Content Delivery Network  
It hosts libraries like React online, so you can include them in your HTML using a `<script>` tag.

### 🟨 React CDN for Development

Use these when you are **just learning or testing React**:



```<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script> <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>```

*   `react.development.js`: React core library
    
*   `react-dom.development.js`: Lets React render to the DOM (browser)
    

* * *

### 🟩 React CDN for Production

Use these when you are **publishing your project** (they are faster and smaller):


`<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"></script> <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>`

> Replace `18` with the version number you want.  
> Example: `@17`, `@16.14.0`, etc.

* * *

### ❓ What is `crossorigin` in the `<script>` tag?

The `crossorigin` attribute tells the browser:

*   "I'm loading this script from another website (CDN), and I want to allow error reporting and security checks."
    

React recommends adding `crossorigin` **so that if something goes wrong**, the browser can report better error messages.

### 🌐 Important Note on CDN and Headers

If you're using a CDN, it should return this HTTP header:



`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`

This means:

> "Any website can access this file."  
> Which is necessary for `crossorigin` to work correctly.

* * *

### ✅ Summary

| Type | Use case | CDN URL example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Development | Testing/learning | react.development.js |
| Production | Real apps | react.production.min.js |
| crossorigin | Better errors and security | Always use it |
